[00:08.72] Full Crate
[00:13.72] 
[00:10.22] Hit me up when the mood's right
[00:11.91] In the moonlight we can walk and talk
[00:14.74] I don't wanna fuss, I don't fight
[00:16.65] But it's been ten years, we should catch up
[00:38.15] 
[00:19.50] You hit me up when we feel safe
[00:21.63] You pck the place, we can walk and talk
[00:24.62] If it ain't rushed, it ain't fake
[00:26.55] I just hope I'm getting through to you
[00:45.55] 
[00:29.52] I feel so tight with guilt
[00:32.07] It happens all the time
[00:34.21] I'm the same, I feel it too
[00:36.99] It happens often
[00:38.76] We're face to face in a public space
[00:41.58] But we won't cross that line
[00:43.79] 'Cause we know we're not to do the moments we're together
[01:12.29] 
[00:48.65] It's nothing wrong if we can bend the rules
[00:51.65] Bend the rules
[00:53.24] It's nothing wrong if we can bend the rules
[00:55.95] To see each other
[00:58.14] It's nothing wrong if we can bend the rules
[01:00.89] It's what we choose
[01:02.74] It's nothing wrong if we can bend the rules
[01:05.51] To see each other
[01:14.01] 
[01:07.77] Hit me up when the time's right
[01:09.62] In the twilight we can walk and talk
[01:12.33] I guess we've both been through it
[01:14.24] But it's been ten years I wanna know how you're doing
[01:40.74] 
[01:17.26] Call me up if you can't sleep
[01:19.27] Don't wanna read, we can get a car
[01:22.29] We can be friends and not creep
[01:24.18] I just hope I'm getting through to you
[01:43.18] 
[01:27.22] I feel so tight with guilt
[01:29.72] It happens all the time
[01:31.89] I'm the same, I feel it too
[01:34.58] It happens often
[01:36.41] We're face to face in a public space
[01:39.10] But we won't cross that line
[01:41.36] 'Cause we know we're not to do the moments we're together
[02:09.86] 
[01:45.94] It's nothing wrong if we can bend the rules
[01:49.17] Bend the rules
[01:50.83] It's nothing wrong if we can bend the rules
[01:53.65] To see each other
[01:55.75] It's nothing wrong if we can bend the rules
[01:58.59] It's what we choose
[02:00.47] It's nothing wrong if we can bend the rules
[02:03.16] To see each other
[02:11.66] 
[02:08.58] Bend the rules
[02:12.37] It's nothing wrong if we can bend the rules
[02:15.42] To see each other
[02:17.82] Bend the rules
[02:22.05] It's nothing wrong if we can bend the rules
[02:24.74] To see each other
[02:33.24] 
[02:40.99] Bend the rules, bend the rules
